            <div id="3-a">
              <h3>What is a workspace?</h3>
              <p>Your workspace is an area within the web-based Scan+Share app where you can work on the documents that you've scanned – whether you wish to edit, rotate, print, generate a different file format, and more. This is also where you can select documents that you wish to share on Google Drive, Evernote, OneDrive – and soon, on Dropbox and more!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="3-b">
              <h3>How many documents can I have in my workspace?</h3>
              <p>You can scan as many documents and pages as you wish as long as you have available capacity on your PC. However, the performance of your Scan+Share app may be compromised when you have more than 50 documents in your workspace at any one time. When you're using the app, the number of scanned documents you have in your workspace is indicated at the bottom of your web browser window.</p>
              <p>To enjoy optimum app performance all the time, you're encouraged to delete your documents from your workspace as soon as you've saved them in your chosen location. This will automatically delete them from your PC's temporary folder as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="3-c">
              <h3>What does the scanned documents indication mean?</h3>
              <p>Every document or page you scan is stored in your PC's temporary folder, until you save it to another location within your PC or on an external hard drive, or share it on the cloud. The scanned documents indication (for example, "25 documents in workspace") tells you how many documents you currently have in your workspace. To enjoy optimum app performance all the time, you're encouraged to delete your documents from your workspace as soon as you've saved them in your chosen location. This will automatically delete them from your PC's temporary folder as well.</p>
              <p>When the scanned documents indication turns red, it's time to free up some space. To do this, simply:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Make sure you've saved the documents you currently have in your workspace. However, do bear in mind that saving these documents will inevitably take up more space in your local disk drive – so you may choose to save them on an external hard drive or share them on the cloud instead.</li>
                <li>Once your documents are saved, you can delete them from your workspace. This will automatically delete them from your PC's temporary folder as well.</li>
                <li>Once you've deleted a sufficient number of documents from your workspace, the scanned documents indication will change from red to yellow (average) or green (ideal).</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div id="3-d">
              <h3>How are my documents stored?</h3>
              <p>Every document or page you scan is stored in your PC's temporary folder, until you save it to another location within your PC or on an external drive, or share it on the cloud. You can choose to generate your scanned documents and pages in PDF, TIFF or ZIP (containing JPG) format, and save them in any location you choose. To enjoy optimum app performance, you're encouraged to delete your documents from your workspace as soon as you've saved them in your chosen location. This will automatically delete them from your PC's temporary folder as well.</p>

            <div id="3-e">
              <h3>Can I save my documents from my workspace on to my PC?</h3>
              <p>Yes, you can save your documents and pages on to your PC or on an external drive, or share your documents on Google Drive, Evernote, OneDrive – and soon, on Dropbox and more. However, saving or sharing your documents doesn't remove them from your workspace. To free up your workspace, you'll have to delete your documents – which you're encouraged to do as soon as you've saved or shared them. This also helps you to enjoy optimum app performance all the time.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="3-f">
              <h3>In what format can I save my document?</h3>
              <p>Your document is automatically generated in PDF format, for you to save on to your PC or on an external drive or share on the cloud. You also have the option of doing so in TIFF and JPG formats.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="3-g">
              <h3>How long can I keep each document in my workspace?</h3>
              <p>Each scanned document stays in your workspace until you delete it. To free up your workspace, you're encouraged to delete your documents and pages as soon as you've saved them on to your PC or an external drive, or shared them on the cloud. This also helps you to enjoy optimum app performance all the time.</p>

            <div id="3-h">
              <h3>Can I scan more than one document or page at a time?</h3>
              <p>Only one document is created per scan. If you use a document feeder, you can scan as many pages as you wish at any one time.</p>
              <p> To create more than one document, simply scan your documents or pages separately.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="3-i">
              <h3>Can I scan more pages into my existing document?</h3>
              <p>Yes, you can. Just right-click on a page of your document, and choose 'Insert' if you wish to scan pages before the selected page or 'Append' to scan pages after the selected page.</p>
              <p>If you wish to re-order the pages within a document, all you have to do is drag and drop. It's that simple!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="3-j">
              <h3>Can I access my documents from a PC that does not have Scan+Share?</h3>
              <p>For security reasons, Scan+Share is designed to keep your scanned documents in your PC's temporary folder so they don't have to leave your PC. This means that you can only access your documents from the PC where you've scanned them on the app. If you have multiple user accounts on your PC, you must be logged in to the account from which your documents are scanned.</p>
              <p>However, you can have as many Scan+Share apps running on as many PCs as you wish – provided they have TWAIN-compliant scanners or multi-function printers connected to them.</p>
              <p>To access your documents from any PC, you can always share them on Google Drive, Evernote, OneDrive – and soon, on Dropbox and more.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="3-k">
              <h3>Do you collect data from my use of Scan+Share?</h3>

              <h3>How can I remove Scan+Share from my PC?</h3>
              <p>When Scan+Share is configured on your PC, you'll have two shortcuts on your desktop – one named 'Scan+ Service' and another named 'Scan+ App'.</p>
              <p>To remove Scan+Share from your PC:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Get the 'RemoveScanPlus.exe' file <a href="../download/RemoveScanPlus.exe" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'CTAS', 'Download', 'RemoveSS2']);" >here</a>. </li>
                <li>Run the file:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>On Google Chrome by clicking on the file (at the bottom left of your web browser window) and selecting 'Run' when prompted.</li>
                  <li>On Internet Explorer 9 or Internet Explorer 10 by selecting 'Run' when prompted.</li>
                  <li>On Firefox by choosing to 'Save File', then double-clicking on the file from your 'Downloads' folder.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>You'll notice that both the 'Scan+ Service' and 'Scan+ App' shortcuts are no longer on your PC's desktop. You may also delete 'RemoveScanPlus.exe' from your Downloads' folder.</li>

              <h3>Who should use Scan+Process Lite?</h3>
              <p>Scan+Process Lite is relevant to every business that requires its customers and users to submit or store paper-based documents electronically. Here is an example of how an insurance company that digitises and processes the medical invoices of their customers may use Scan+Process Lite:</p>
              <p>Currently, health insurance customers send paper or self-scanned documents, images, or digital photographs (from their mobile devices) to the health insurance company, which reimburses its customers by:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Scanning the paper documents</li>
                <li>Converting digital images to files that are readable and manageable</li>
                <li>Extracting the relevant data</li>
              </ul>
              <p>However, the health insurance company is unable to control the quality of the self-scanned documents, images, and digital photographs submitted by its customers. Sometimes, the file sizes are huge. Poor quality scans also prevent the insurance company from extracting relevant data from the documents – leading them to find other means of contacting the customers for clarification.</p>
              <h4>Scan+Process Lite can help the insurance company to:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>centrally control scanner settings through a 'Scan' button on its portal, so that scan quality, file types, and file sizes remain consistent from all customers. This prevents the need to convert images into an acceptable format, and ensures that there is no need to contact customers for clarification of information.</li>
                <li>make data submission seamless for customers by making the scan client accessible to them from most browsers, through the insurance portal. This self service feature ensures the accuracy of information submitted, as it is provided directly by the customers.</li>
                <li>extract the relevant information, complete the necessary checks, and pass on the data to the health insurance company. This leads to a quicker processing of reimbursements to customers.</li>
                <li>lower time and cost of document processing.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>What is the difference between Scan+Process Lite and Scan+Process?</h3>
              <p>Scan+Process Lite is an easy-to-use, web-based scan client – designed for organisations that scan documents in single or multiple locations, and require optimum security.</p>
              <p>If you require document processing capabilities beyond the basic document scanning, Scan+Process provides a fully featured Document Process Automation (DPA) platform where you can perform Automatic Data Extraction and Classification, as well as exception handling processes such as Data Validation, Rescan, and much more.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="4-e">
              <h3>How does Scan+Process Lite work with my existing Line of Business application?</h3>
              <p>Various levels of integration are possible, and we can work with your organisation to determine the right one for your needs. Here is an example of a common scenario:</p>
              <p>The Line of Business application invokes the web-based Scan+Process Lite user interface. This means that the user is already authenticated by their Line of Business application, and no additional login is required. When the user is accessing Scan+Process Lite, the app will display information that is relevant to the Line of Business application – such as the user's login name and metadata he or she is required to provide.</p>
              <p>After documents have been scanned, the user can edit the metadata and Scan+Process Lite can verify the metadata against the rules of the Line of Business application.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, Scan+Process Lite will establish a connection with the Line of Business application directly from the PC or laptop from where the user is scanning. Once the connection is established, the documents and index information are uploaded directly to the Line of Business application, without the need to pass through our servers. This guarantees optimum security and privacy for the documents and data managed through Scan+Process Lite.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="4-f">
              <h3>How secure is Scan+Process Lite?</h3>
              <p>All document-related metadata and images never pass through our servers. They are transmitted directly from the user's PC or laptop (from where he or she is scanning) to the Line of Business application. This optimum security makes Scan+Process Lite the ideal solution for organisations where the security and privacy of documents and data are critical, and information cannot be shared outside of the organisation's network.</p>
              <p>Data transfer from between Scan+Process Lite and the Line of Business application is encrypted, through HTTPS or any other method supported by the Line of Business application.</p>
