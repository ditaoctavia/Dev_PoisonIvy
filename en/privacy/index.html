            <p>Our Privacy Policy describes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The information we collect from you. </li>
              <li>How we use this information. </li>

            <h3>Information we collect from you</h3>
            <p>Generally, you can use our apps without revealing any personally identifiable information. However, from time to time, we collect information from users such as you to provide better, and more relevant services and features on our apps. This information is collected in two ways: </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>What you give us.</b> For example, when you voluntarily share your email address and/or 'Like' our social media pages such as Facebook and LinkedIn. </li>
              <li><b>What we gather from your use of our apps.</b> We may collect information about the apps you use and how you use them – such as the way you respond to new features on our apps, or the ads on our webpages. This includes:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Device information.</b> We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers). </li>
                  <li><b>Log information.</b> This may include: <br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Details of how you use our app, such as your scanning activities and document generating selections. </li>
                      <li>Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is a numerical label assigned to your device (such as a computer or multi-function printer), participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. </li>
                      <li>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. </li>
                      <li>Cookies, which are pieces of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you, which may uniquely identify the type of browser you use (such as Internet Explorer 9, Google Chrome or Firefox). Generally, cookies do not permit us to personally identify you. </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Location information.</b> We may request that you share your geographical location upon registration. We will not determine your location through other means, such as using sensor data from your device to identify nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. </li>
                  <li><b>Unique application numbers.</b> Certain apps may include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to CumulusPro when you install or uninstall that app or when that app periodically contacts our servers. </li>
                  <li><b>Local storage.</b> We may collect information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and app data caches. Such information will not be transmitted to and/or stored on our servers. </li>
                  <li><b>Cookies and anonymous identifiers.</b> We collect and store information in various ways, which may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. This may also be done when you interact with the services we offer through our partners. </li>
                </ul>

            <p>This information may vary based on your interaction, the social media site platform, and your privacy settings on that site. You can find out more about these from the social media site where you interact with us. </p>

            <h3>Transparency and choice</h3>
            <p>We realise that your privacy concerns may be different from another user's. This is why we strive to be clear about the information we collect and how we use it, so that you can make meaningful choices about what you would like to provide.</p>

            <h3>Accessing and updating your personal information</h3>
            <p>Whenever you use our app, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is incorrect, we strive to enable you to update it quickly or delete it – unless we have to store that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
            <p>When you request for your personal information to be updated or changed, we have the right to reject the request if deemed unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical.</p>
            <p>Where we can provide easy access to and correction of information, we will do so for free. If it requires a disproportionate effort, we have the right to charge for the service. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. </p>

            <h3>Application</h3>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the apps we offer as well as those offered by our affiliates, including services offered on other sites, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including those linked from our apps and web pages.
